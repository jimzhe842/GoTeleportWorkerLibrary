# **Take Home Project**

## **Summary**
----
My interpretation of this exercise is to build a server that stores jobs. These jobs can be run in a worker library that can be remotely managed through a secure channel by those who are authorized. A major assumption I am making is that all jobs have outputs and are only meant to be run once. A stopped or finished job cannot be run again. You would have to schedule a new job in that case. This will simplify the implementation.

## **Worker Library**
----
Firstly, the number of workers will be hardcoded but this could be moved into a configuration file in the future. Limiting the number of workers will control CPU usage, in case the server is needed for any other tasks. The worker library will include a variable storing a map of user authorization names to maps of  pointers to `job` instances. The map data structure allows for easy random access with authorization implemented.
Eg. (in json representation)
```json
// map variable
{
  "client-1": {
    "a8c5d1v4": "pointer to job instance"
  }
}

```
The global nature of this state requires not only a lock for the map variable above but one for every `job` instance pointer. Jobs will be stored in memory, as persistent storage will not be implemented. The drawback is that if a server goes down all the in memory data will be wiped. Furthermore, the resulting architecture is meant to handle only small amounts of traffic and not super intensive CPU tasks. This will not provide for a highly available system unless it is vertically or horizontally scaled.

The worker library will export three methods: `Start`, `Stop`, and `Query`.

The `Start` method takes in a `filepath` representing the path to the job bin file, and a variable number of arguments. (I'm assuming that the jobs sit on separate files on the same server.) Furthermore, this method will instantiate a new `job` instance pointer and assign it to a worker through a `jobs` channel. The job ids will be a randomly generated 8 byte alphanumeric string.
This `job` instance will have the following signature:

```go
type job struct {
  id string // id of length 8 to perform actions on jobs
  user string // represents the common name from the client certificate for authorization
  command string // command to run the job with args
  status Status // status of the job intialized to "starting" ("starting", "running", "stopped", or "finished")
  ctx context.Context // context for the exec.CommandContext
  cancel context.CancelFunc // cancel func to stop a job
  output string // result of a finished job
  lock sync.Mutex // read/write locks
}
```

The worker will execute the command with the `exec.CommandContext` function to create a stoppable process. At this point the job has a status of `running`. While it is running, the worker will periodically check any partially finished job outputs and write that to the output field. After, a `job` instance is processed by a worker, the worker will lock the `job` set the `status` and `output` to the appropriate values.

The `Stop` method takes in a `job` id, references the `job` pointer and call its cancel function to stop the job. A stopped job will not have an output and its status will be set to `stopped`.
The `cancel` method will be initialized like this:
```go
ctx, cancel := context.withCancel(context.Background())
exec.CommandContext(ctx, "cat", "file.txt")
job.cancel = cancel
job.ctx = ctx
```

Therefore, calling cancel should stop the process that was started by the `CommandContext` function.

A job that has completed will have the `output` field set to the job result and with a status of `finished`.

The `Query` method also takes in a job id and will return the relevant job info back to the caller.

Overall, this library was not designed to have workers finish in the order in which they are scheduled. As soon as they finish they will write the results to the `job` instance.

## **API**
----
The HTTP API will run on mTLS with the common name field used for authorization <!--and JWT authorization-->. 
<!-- In particular, TLS 1.3 will be used to set up a secure communication channel. It is not only more secure but also has a shorter handshake than previous versions.  -->
In particular, TLS 1.3 defaults will be used to set up a secure communication channel. The default TLS 1.3 ciphers will be used.
<!-- The cipher suites to be used are: TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 because they are supported by Golang. -->

Two self-signed Root CAs will be used as the basis of verification, one each for the client and server certificates. For convenience, openSSL will be used to generate the keys, CSRs and certificates. In the future, there could be a system in place for the server to generate certificates for the client. Localhost will be used for the common name field of the CSR. Meanwhile a generic name like "client-1" will be used for the client CSR common name. In the future, since CSR/certification generation will be handled in the codebase, this will be set to the configured server domain name.

The API consists of the following endpoints:

**POST** `/start`
- client sends a json body that has the job `filePath`, and also the arguments to schedule a new job
<!-- - client also needs to send an authorization header -->
- returns a status 200 if the filePath leads to a bin file and the arguments are valid, also returns the job id
- returns a status 404 if the filePath does not exist
- returns a status 422 if the arguments are not valid
- returns a status 403 if the client is unauthorized

eg:
```json
// request
{
  "command": "cat file.txt",
}

//response (success)
{
  "id": 1
}
```

**POST** `/stop`
<!-- - client sends a json body of the job id to stop a job and an authorization header -->
- returns a status 200 if the id exists
  - if the job was already completed, return the status and output
  - if the job was already stopped previously or successfully stopped, return the string-encoded output
- returns a status 404 if the id does not exist
- returns a status 403 if the client is unauthorized

eg:
```json
// request
{
  "id": 1,
}

//response (success)
{
  "status": "Stopped",
  "output": null,
}
```

**GET** `/query`
<!-- - client also needs to send an authorization header -->
- returns a status 200 with a list of all scheduled jobs, including their relevant info like id, status, and output
- returns a status 403 if the client is unauthorized

eg:
```json
// request (no json needed)

//response (success)
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "status": "Completed",
    "output": "1",
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "status": "Stopped",
    "output": null,
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "status": "Running",
    "output": null,
  }
]
```

**GET** `/query/:id`
<!-- - client also needs to send an authorization header -->
- returns a status 200 with the job of the id sent, including their relevant info like id, status, and output
- returns a status 404 if the job id does not exist
- returns a status 403 if the client is unauthorized
```json
// request (no json needed)

//response (success)
{
  "id": 1,
  "status": "Completed",
  "output": "1",
}
```

## **CLI**
----
The client CLI will store their pregenerated certificate in memory for the mTLS handshake.

### **CLI Commands**

Let's call the CLI command `rw` for remote worker.

### **Connecting**

```
$ rw connect [server addr]
```

eg:
```
$ rw connect localhost:3000
```

Sets up the mTLS handshake and creates a persistent TCP connection with the remote server, where the server response has an HTTP header `Connection: Keep-Alive`. This will create a process that listens for user input, thus allowing reuse of the TCP connection, until the process gets "Control-C" by the user, or is exited out.

Thus the below commands are for this process session, which blocks on user input.

### **Starting a job**

```
$ start [path to bin] [args]
```

eg:
```
$ start add.exe 8 10
```

For simplicity the args will get converted to integers

### **Stopping a job**

```
$ stop [id]
```

Id will be the job id

### **Query**

```
$ ls
```

Example output:

```
$ ls

Id: 1, Status: Running, Output: Null
```

This will list all the active or completed/stopped jobs for which the user has authorization.
An optional id argument can be supplied to get the information for one job.
The output should be mostly up to date with the output as the job is running, since the worker will periodically check the output and write it to the job.



## **Authorization**
The authorization will be done by the server checking the common-name field of the client certificate and making sure that the job instance has the matching common-name field. Overall, it will be user based and one user can only access jobs that they created and not others.
